        Global Hunger and Famine
    </h13> 
    <h6>
        There are many things wrong with the our planet today. One of those things
        are <strong>poverty</strong> <br> which leads to <strong>famine</strong> This has been a silent killer for many
        centuries since this makes no loud noises, no visual displays and it takes
        the life of so many, so silently. However, famine has been an issue mostly
        every organisation has been addressing. Now in the visualisation, we will
        look at what are the <strong>consequences of hunger and how far we have come.</strong>
        <br>
        <br>
        The <strong>primary indicator of hunger </strong>used by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization <br>
        is the <strong>prevalence of undernourishment</strong> as a percentage of the population.<br>
        <br>
        According to Roser & Ritchie (2019), it calculates the proportion of the population<br>
        whose calorie consumption falls short of the minimal levels of energy considered <br>
        necessary for a specific population.<br>

    <h1>Countries with the most growth in terms of eliminating stunting</h1> 
    <div id="bar_graph"> 
    </div>
    <h5 class="first-txt">
        Bangladesh and China had the greatest improvements. With the highest <br>improvements
        being from 1990 to 2000.<br>
        <br>
        United States had little to no improvement at all. The line being <br>
        uninterrupted from 1991 to 2014.
    </h5> 
    <p> Stunting is a term used to describe the condition where a child
        under the <strong>age of 5 cannot reach their optimal physical size.</strong> <br>
<br>
        Sometimes, this is caused by rare conditions but this is also caused by
        lack of food and nutrition, in other words, hunger. This happens in <strong>underdeveloped countries</strong>
        or countries with a lot of misuse of government money (corruption, etc). But still most
        countries are working towards improving this as shown in the graph.
        <br>
        <br>
        To understand how many children
        are suffering from a growth stunt, we must first see which countries suffer
        from lack of food and nutrition.

    <h2>Prevalence of global hunger</h2>
    <div id="map">
    </div>
<div class="ann">
    <h7 class="na">
        North America
    </h7>
    <h8 class="asia">
        Asia
    </h8>
    <h9 class="sa">
        South America
    </h9>
    <h10 class="africa">
        Africa
    </h10>
    <h11 class="innotation">
        Prevalence is highest in Africa.<br>
    </h11>
</div>
    <p> We can see that most of<strong> North America and Asia is low</strong> in the prevalence of
        hunger. While <strong>South America and Africa has countries with incredibly high prevalence</strong>
        of hunger.
        <br>
<br>
Why is NA and Asia low in the prevalence of hunger you might ask: this has to do with the development of 
the major countries in the region.
<br>
<br>
According to Fisher (2015), this is the product of numerous variables, including riches, an innovative culture and economy, education, substantial state- and privately-funded research initiatives, and a political climate that has historically drawn educated immigration.
<br>
<br>
However, let us test if our hypothesis is true. If <strong>stunting is truly related with hunger and undernourishment</strong>.       
</p>

    <h3>Stunting occurences among children</h3>
    <div id="scatter">
    </div>
    <h12>
        There seems to be a positive relationship between Stunting<br>
        and Hunger Index<br><br>

        Africa and Asia are dominating the higher prevalence levels<br>
        regarding stunting.<br><br>

        Europe and North America seems to be a healthy region.
    </h12>
    <p> According to Roser & Ritchie (2019), the Global Hunger Index has been the primary measurement system to capture
        and track the process of hunger within a single metric. The index is calculated of
        4 elements, <strong>undernourishment, Stunting, Wasting, and child mortality.</strong>
        <br>
        <br>
        Putting the index against the stunting records in the scatter plot has shown us that
        there indeed is a correlation between hunger index and stunting. We can safely conclude 
        that <strong>malnourishment is the main cause of stunting.</strong>
        <br>
        <br>
        Africa and Asia have the highest number of countries with<strong> high hunger index
        and therefore has the most occurences of stunting.</strong>
    </p>

    <h4>Global Hunger Index</h4>
    <div id="map_3">
    </div>
    <p> Hunger index's scale ranges from 0 to 100. They are classified in the following ways.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Extremely alarming</strong> : 50 or higher
        <br>
        <strong>Alarming</strong>: 35 to 50
        <br>
        <strong>Serious</strong>: 20 to 35
        <br>
        <strong>Moderate</strong>: 10 to 20
        <br>
        <strong>Low</strong>: below 10
        <br>
        <br>
        According to Roser & Ritchie (2019), the overall number of persons who are considered to be seriously food insecure is shown in the charts. Around<strong> 697 million people experienced extreme food insecurity</strong> worldwide in 2018.

Nearly <strong>40% of individuals who experienced extreme food insecurity lived in Africa</strong>, and more than<strong> half were in Asia</strong>. The <strong>Americas, Europe, and Oceania each received 10%</strong> of the total.
<br>
<br>
Moving on to actions taken and progress, organisation such as the United Nations (UN) and World Food Programme (WFP), has taken action.
As years pass the improvement can be seen, in 2018 data, we can see that there are little countries in Asia and
South America with high hunger indexes. According to UN (2021), programmes such as<strong> food assistance </strong>from the WFP has taken place.
This has <strong>reduced the global hunger index </strong>by incredible amounts.
